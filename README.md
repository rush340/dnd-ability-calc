# D&D 5e Point Buy Calculator

An ability score Point Buy calculator for character creation in Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition.

Try it out it [here](https://rush340.github.io/dnd-ability-calc)

I'm not a huge fan of the standard Point Buy rules because the allowed distributions are so much more restrictive than with rolling. I hope to add a feature for defining custom point buy costs (with optionally different upper/lower limits) such that a DM can send a link to the calculator with their own configuration to their players.


## TODO

- get this TODO list out of the README
- reset button
- usability improvements
    - convey to user that incr/decr not allowed because score is at min/max allowed value
    - convey to user that incr/decr not allowed because of insufficient points
    - maybe a blurb about what this thing is
    - some kind of info page
- some way to see the cost table and min/max scores (maybe on info page)
