# D&D Point Buy Calculator

An ability score Point Buy calculator for D&D 5e.

Currently a work in progress.

Try it out it [here](https://rush340.github.io/dnd-ability-calc)

I plan to add the ability to define extended point buy tables such that a DM can send a link to the calculator with the custom table to their players.


## TODO

- camelCase var names
- refactor (it's all in one file right now)
- styling
- usability improvements
    - convey to user that incr/decr not allowed because score is at min/max allowed value
    - convey to user that incr/decr not allowed because of insufficient points
    - maybe a blurb about what this thing is
    - some kind of info page
- some way to see the cost table and min/max scores
